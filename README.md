Pauline
---

A formalization of (a subset of) SML semantics in Lean.

Called "Pauline" because it sounds like a mashup of "Polly", the course mascot
of [150](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/index.html) and "Lean".

This is held together with zipties and hotglue. A lot of it would need to be
re-written to get into a usable state.
